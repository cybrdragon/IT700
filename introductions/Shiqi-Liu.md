This is Shiqi Liu. I am a first-year Ph.D. student at the Center for Secure Information Systems (CSIS), George Mason University, advised by Dr. Kun Sun. 
My research focuses on systems security, including confidential computing, trusted execution environments (TEEs), and software-hardware co-design.
