Name: Taylor Jackson

Research Interests: My research interests lie at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction and Educational Technology. I aim to focus on inclusive design, AI-driven multimodal learning technologies, and computing education. I am particularly interested in how these areas can support marginalized and underrepresented populations, including students with disabilities, neurodivergence, racial and ethnic minorities, and those in rural communities.
