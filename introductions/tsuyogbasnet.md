Hi, I am **Tsuyog Basnet**,

I did my Masters in computer science from Canada, BSc from New Zealand. I primarily worked with clinical data (MIMIC III/IV) to develop a deep learning model, [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0933365723000404).

I am a first year PhD student in the Dept of INFT and researcher at Language Technology lab. My current goal is to finish the degree with some contribution in the field. 

My research areas are Multimodal Machine learning and NeuroSymbolic AI, and also collaborate with robotics lab at GMU for multimodal Navigation. 

I dont have concrete plan yet, but will certainly depend on how this PhD goes.
